Accessing and Analyzing YouTube Data


The YouTube Data API allows developers to retrieve insights about videos, playlists, and channels, including metrics like views, likes, comments, and metadata such as titles and upload dates. This enables applications like content analysis, visualization, and performance tracking.

Steps to Access and Analyze Data

API Key: Enable the YouTube Data API in the Google Cloud Console and generate an API key.
Data Retrieval: Use Python to fetch video details and statistics (e.g., views, likes) from playlists using API endpoints like playlistItems and videos.

Data Parsing: Process the JSON response to extract details like video titles, descriptions, and engagement metrics.

Export: Save the processed data into an Excel file using pandas.


Visualization with Power BI

Import the Excel file into Power BI.

Create interactive dashboards to visualize trends in views, likes, and comments.

Use scatter plots and bar charts to identify top-performing videos and audience engagement patterns.


Output Highlights

Key Metrics: Titles, descriptions, video URLs, views, likes, dislikes, comments, and durations.

Interactive Insights: Identify popular videos and trends visually.


Applications

Content Analysis: Measure video performance and engagement.

Trend Analysis: Explore trending topics and campaigns.

Channel Management: Monitor and organize playlist content effectively.


By combining the YouTube API with Power BI, this approach streamlines data collection, analysis, and visualization for actionable insights.
