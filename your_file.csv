LYRICS:
I know I have good judgement
I know I have good taste
It‚Äôs funny and it‚Äôs ironic
That only I feel that way
I promise ‚Äòem that you‚Äôre different
And everyone makes mistakes
But just don‚Äôt
 
I heard that you‚Äôre an actor
So act like a stand up guy
Whatever devils inside you
Don‚Äôt let him out tonight
I tell them it‚Äôs just your culture
And everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah I know
 
All I‚Äôm asking baby
 
Please please please don‚Äôt prove I‚Äôm right
Please please please
Don‚Äôt bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing
My egos another
I beg you don‚Äôt embarrass me
Mother fucker ahhh
Please please please
 
Well I have a fun idea babe
Maybe just stay inside
I know you‚Äôre craving some fresh air
But the ceiling fan is so nice
And we could live so happily
If no one knows that you‚Äôre with me
I‚Äôm just kidding
But really
Kinda
Really
Really
 
Please please please don‚Äôt prove I‚Äôm right
Please please please
Don‚Äôt bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing
My egos another
I beg you don‚Äôt embarrass me
Mother fucker ahhh
Please please please
 
If you wanna go and be stupid
Don‚Äôt do it in front of me
If you don‚Äôt wanna cry to my music
Don‚Äôt make me hate you prolifically
Please please please
Please please please
Please
Please
Please

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
My baby want a Birkin
, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This 9 to 5 ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone (Uh)


[Pre-Chorus]
One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round"", we need plenty more
Two steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord




[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history
Ther–µ's a party downtown, near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar g–µttin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy


[Verse 2]
I've been Boozey since I left, I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma', I ain't forget (Oh, Lord, uh)
Woke up drunk at 10 a.m., we gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend (Oh, Lord)


[Pre-Chorus]
One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round"", we need plenty more
Two steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord


[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (A double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (We go way back)


There's a party downtown, near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (At the bar gettin' tipsy)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy


[Bridge]
One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four
When it's last call and they kick us out the door
It's gettin' kind of late but the ladies want some more
Oh my, good Lord (Tell 'em drinks on me)


[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (A double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (Way back)
There's a party downtown, near 5th Street (Come on)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo-ooh)
Can someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (A double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (It's Jack D)
At the bottom of a bottle gon' miss me (Baby, don't miss me)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (At the bar gettin' tipsy)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

[Outro]
That's fuckin' messed up, bro, they kicked me out the bar

üé§ Lyrics: Teddy Swims - Lose Control 

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don't know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closing in
And the devil's knocking at my door, whoa

Outta my mind, how many times
Did I tell you I'm no good at being alone?
Yeah it's taking a toll on me, trying my best to keep
From tearing the skin off my bones, don't you know

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm falling apart right in front of you
Can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

Problematic, problem is
I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habit's hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah I know, I could do it on my own, but I want
That real full moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic, problem is
When I'm with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darling please, oh

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm falling apart right in front of you
Can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah

I lose control
When you're not here with me
I'm falling apart right in front of you
Can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

(Lyrics):
[Verse 1]
It's fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth
And guess I'm the fool
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You only wanna be the one that I call baby

[Chorus]
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

[Verse 2]
I'm clich√©, who cares?
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
And I cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I'm gonna call it off
Even if you call it love
I just wanna love someone who calls me baby

[Chorus]
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)

good luck babe chappell roan,
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

[Bridge]
When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife
And when you think about me, all of those years ago
You're standing face to face with ""I told you so""
You know I hate to say it, I told you so
You know I hate to say, but I told you so

[Chorus]
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (Well, I told you so)
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

[Outro]
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

Lyrics:
For a while there it was rough 
But lately I‚Äôve been doing better 
Than the last four cold Decembers
I recall 
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She‚Äôll come and stay the night
I think I might have it all 
And I thank god everyday 
For the girl he sent my way 
But I know the things he gives me
He can take away 
And I hold you every night
That‚Äôs a feeling I wanna get used to 
But there‚Äôs no man as terrified 
As the man who stands to lose you 
Oh I hope I don‚Äôt lose you
Mmm
Please 
Stay
I want you I need you oh God
Don‚Äôt 
Take
These beautiful things that I‚Äôve got
Please stay 
I want you I need you oh God
Don‚Äôt take
These beautiful things that I‚Äôve got
Please don‚Äôt take,
I found my mind I‚Äôm feeling sane
It‚Äôs been a while but I‚Äôm finding my faith
If everything‚Äôs good and it‚Äôs great why do I sit and wait till it‚Äôs gone
Oh I‚Äôll tell ya I know I‚Äôve got enough
I got peace,
And I got love,
But I‚Äôm up at night thinking I just might lose it all
Please stay 
I want you I need you oh God
Don‚Äôt take
These beautiful things that I‚Äôve got
Please stay
I want you I need you oh god
I need
These beautiful things that I‚Äôve got

Lyrics:

[Intro]
The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy

[Verse 1]
So clean the house, clear the drawers, mop the floors, stand tall
Like no one's ever been here before or at all
And don't you mention all the inches that are scraped on the doorframe
We all know you tiptoed up to 4'1"" back in '08

[Chorus]
If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppi–µs
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God h–µard you comin'

[Verse 2]
The kids are in town for a funeral
And the grass all smells the same as the day you broke your arm swingin'
On that kid out on the river
You bailed him out, never said a thing about Jesus or the way he's livin'

[Chorus]
If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God heard you comin'

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God heard you comin'

[Outro]
The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy

Lyrics: 
Rumors goin‚Äô all over town
Can‚Äôt keep my name out they mouth these days, yeah they say
I live too fast to settle down
Truth is I just ain‚Äôt about these games they all play
 
Wanna find somethin‚Äô stronger than the whiskey
And oh I‚Äôve tried, but every time I feel her kiss me
I keep comin' up empty yeah
 
I just wanna love somebody
Who won't leave a hole in my heart
I just wanna love somebody
That don‚Äôt want me fallin‚Äô apart
And I‚Äôll be lucky if I ever find
A somethin' more than just a crazy night
I just wanna love somebody
 
Who ain't hypnotized
By dollar signs and blindin' lights, like they tend to be, yeah
I need someone that I'd be proud
To take on back to my hometown
Honest eyes that just ain‚Äôt gonna lead to
 
Lonely nights even when she‚Äôs up against me
I don‚Äôt know why it feels like there‚Äôs nobody with me
And I‚Äôm still empty, yeah
 
I just wanna love somebody
Who won't leave a hole in my heart
I just wanna love somebody
That don‚Äôt want me fallin‚Äô apart
And I‚Äôll be lucky if I ever find
A somethin' more than just a crazy night
I just wanna love somebody
 
I just wanna love somebody
(Wooah)
 
I just wanna love somebody
Who won't leave a hole in my heart
I just wanna love somebody
That don‚Äôt want me fallin‚Äô apart
And I‚Äôll be lucky if I ever find
A somethin' more than just a crazy night
I just wanna love somebody

Lyrics:
I ain‚Äôt never rep a set baby
I ain‚Äôt do no wrong
I could clean up good for you
Oh I know right from wrong
Cause I wanna make it (so badly)
I‚Äôm a Million Dollar Baby (don‚Äôt at me)
Hell no

You rep my city for so damn long
But you still don‚Äôt notice me
My sound next
VA next
I‚Äôm at they neck
I‚Äôm running up a check
She a bad lil mama she a diva
No matter what happens he cannot come between us again
I know we‚Äôre better than friends (better than friends)
I took her to Queen‚Äôs Gambit, showed around my friends
Tried to pick some energy up it don‚Äôt better
I know you haven‚Äôt moved on, if you tried
I don‚Äôt believe it baby, I know you lied
All night long
What you mean I changed
Haven't stayed the same
I‚Äôve been losing my mind
I said the city is mine

I ain‚Äôt never rep a set baby
Ain‚Äôt do no wrong
I could clean up, do it for you
Oh I know right from wrong
Cause I wanna make it (so badly)
I‚Äôm a Million Dollar Baby (don‚Äôt at me)
I ain‚Äôt never rep a set baby
Ain‚Äôt do no wrong
I could clean up, good for you
Oh I know right from wrong
Cause I wanna make it (so badly)
I‚Äôm a Million Dollar Baby (don‚Äôt at me)

Hell no
Hell no
Hell no

My love‚Äôs beyond the pain but if i miss the brake, we‚Äôre dancing in the flames
Its indescribable
Ooooooh

So grab the wheel, want you to be in control

Everything‚Äôs faded
We barely made it

But you're still beautiful
And it‚Äôs amazing
Cause i can taste it

LYRICS:
Sun is going down, time is running out
No one else around but me
Steady losing light
Steady losing my mind
Moving shadows and grinding teeth

Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I‚Äôd do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you I keep

Slippin into bad dreams
Where there‚Äôs no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these bad dreams
Waiting on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free from all of these, all of these 
(ooh) Bad dreams
(ooh) All of these, baby, please

Come around
Help me settle down
Hellish habits can cloud my head
What you waiting for
Something physical
I can‚Äôt do this by myself

Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I‚Äôd do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you I keep

Slippin into bad dreams
Where there‚Äôs no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these (all of these) bad dreams
Waiting on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free (set me free) from all of these, all of these
(ooh) Bad dreams, baby, please
(ooh) All of these (baby, please) all of these

Lyrics:
All my life
Don't think I've ever seen a dress that tight
Come around with those emerald eyes
Hiding out in the bathroom!

Jesus Christ
Try to act all casual
Hell bound in a crowded room
Running around trying to find you
Stressing me out

How much longer can we?
Keep things under the table
Bottled up ripping off the label
God I just wanna take you home

How much longer can we wait
Baby leave that dress out on the sidewalk
Running naked down the street ain't no shame oh
God I just wanna take you home

Hide your grin
Anytime we hangout with all your friends
Footsie like it's 7th grade
Baby drive me wild you
Stressing me out

How much longer can we? 
Keep things under the table
Bottled up ripping off the label
God I just wanna take you home

How much longer can we wait
Baby leave that dress out on the sidewalk
Running naked down the street ain't no shame oh
God I just wanna take you home

You make me wanna scream it out loud
Want you right here right now
Love takes time and patience
For you I'll wait it out

You make me wanna scream it out loud 
I want you right here right now
But love takes time and patience
For you I'll wait it out

Lyrics:
 
Time stood still
Just like a photograph
You made me feel
Like this would last forever
Looking in your eyes
I see my whole life

Ooh
They say you know it when you know it
And I know
Ooh
Promise that you‚Äôll hold me close don‚Äôt let me go
Hey!

Take my heart don‚Äôt break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazing
Intertwining souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along

I lose my mind
When I‚Äôm around you how I come alive
When I‚Äôm without you
I can‚Äôt help but feel so lost
I wanna give you all I‚Äôve got

Ooh
They say you know it when you know it
And I know
Ooh
Promise that you‚Äôll hold me close don‚Äôt let me go
Hey!

Take my heart don‚Äôt break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazing
Intertwining souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along

Take my heart don‚Äôt break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along

‚ñ∫Lyrics:

(Verse 1)
Last callers, last chancers
9 to 5ers, truckers, dancers
Couple Chuck‚Äôs, Ern‚Äôs, and Chandler‚Äôs
With a whole lotta prayers unanswered
Whiskey by noon, and beer before that
Southbound train on a hellbound track
Might just put two middle fingers up and throw one back for all the
People who ain‚Äôt ever felt at home
Just spinnin‚Äô on a rock and gettin‚Äô stoned

(Chorus)
Yeah this one‚Äôs for the Losers
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain‚Äôt never been no winners
Let‚Äôs hear it for the Losers
Ain‚Äôt got nowhere to fit in
There‚Äôs a place you can always get in
Oh
You might be lonely but you‚Äôre never alone
You‚Äôre right here where you‚Äôre supposed to be
Right here with all the Losers
The one‚Äôs like you
And the one‚Äôs like me

(Verse 2) (Jelly Roll)
My therapist is a good bartender
Heart breakers and two month benders
Bad times that we can‚Äôt forget and
Good times that we won‚Äôt remember
Raise ‚Äòem up when we hear a sad song
Love the cry of a steel guitar
No way to change the way we are

(Chorus) (Jelly Roll)
This one‚Äôs for the Losers
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain‚Äôt never been no winners
Let‚Äôs hear it for the Losers
Ain‚Äôt got nowhere to fit in
There‚Äôs a place you can always get in
Oh, oh
You might be lonely but you‚Äôre never alone
You‚Äôre right here where you‚Äôre supposed to be
Right here with all the Losers
The one‚Äôs like you
And the one‚Äôs like me

(Bridge) (Post)
If you‚Äôre livin‚Äô like you got nothin‚Äô to lose

(Bridge) (Jelly Roll)
There‚Äôs a spot for you beside me on this stool

(Chorus) (Post & Jelly Roll)
Come kick it with the Losers
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain‚Äôt never been no winners
Let‚Äôs hear it for the Losers
Ain‚Äôt got nowhere to fit in
There‚Äôs a place you can always get in
Oh, oh
You might be lonely but you‚Äôre never alone
You‚Äôre right here where you‚Äôre supposed to be
Right here with all the Losers
The one‚Äôs like you
And the one‚Äôs like me

LYRICS

I know that this could hurt me bad 
I know that this could feel like that 
But I just can‚Äôt stop
Let my defences drop

I know that I was born to kill 
Any angel on my windowsill 
But it‚Äôs so dark inside
I throw the windows wide

I know La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I know La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Still I don‚Äôt let go
And fields of flowers grow

Oh
It feels like I‚Äôm falling in love 
Maybe for the first time 
Baby it‚Äôs my mind you blow

It feels like I‚Äôm falling in love 
You‚Äôre throwing me a lifeline 
This is for a lifetime, I know

I know that in this kind of scene
Of two people there‚Äôs a spark between
One gets torn apart, one gets a broken heart

I know La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I know La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Still I don‚Äôt let go
And fields of flowers grow

Oh
It feels like I‚Äôm falling in love 
Maybe for the first time 
Baby it‚Äôs my mind you blow

Feels like I‚Äôm falling in love 
You‚Äôre throwing me a lifeline 
This is for a lifetime, I know

Feels like I‚Äôm falling in love 
You‚Äôre throwing me a lifeline 
Oh now for the first time
I know I‚Äôm not alone

Lyrics: 

Opened up my journal to a page
Everything that hurts me‚Äôs still the same
Feels like there‚Äôs nothing new for me to say
Why why why
Why why why
Sweating through the sheets shakin‚Äô in bed
Visions of her naked in my head
But I went off and chose myself instead
Why why why
Ease my mind
I don't know why, I
I don‚Äôt know, I dont know why
Why why why
I stepped off the stage with nothing left
All the lights were fuckin‚Äô with my head
But here I am, singing songs again
Why why why
Ease my mind
I don‚Äôt know why, I
I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt know why
Why why why
Why why why
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it goes
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it
Thought I was about to be a father
Shook me to the core, I‚Äôm still a kid
Sometimes I still cry out for my mother
Why why why
Why why why
I don‚Äôt know why, I
I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt know why
Why why why
Why why why
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it goes
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it goes

Official ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt be friends (wait for your love)‚Äù Lyrics:
i didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd understand me how could you ever even try
i don‚Äôt want to tiptoe
but i don‚Äôt wanna hide
but i don‚Äôt want to feed this monstrous fire
just want to let this story die and i‚Äôll be alright
we can‚Äôt be friends
but i‚Äôd like to just pretend
you cling to your papers and pens wait until you like me again
wait for your love
love
i'll want for your love
me and my truth we sit in silence baby girl it‚Äôs just me and you cause i don‚Äôt wanna argue
but i don‚Äôt wanna bite
my tongue yeah i think i'd rather die
you got me misunderstood but at least i look this good
we can‚Äôt be friends
but i‚Äôd like to just pretend
you cling to your papers and pens wait until you like me again
wait for your love
love
i'll want for your love
know that you made me
i don‚Äôt like how you paint me yet i‚Äôm still here hanging
not what you made me something like a daydream but i feel so seen in the night so for now it‚Äôs only me
and maybe that‚Äôs all i need
we can‚Äôt be friends
but i‚Äôd like to just pretend
you cling to your papers and pens wait until you like me again
wait for your love
love
i'll want for your love

Banging it banging it wanna echo through the halls
Pulling up fresh face brand new d√≠a

I go go to the root
Off to bloom yeah

Pain has come and gone again
Walked through that fire rediscover ah ah

Revving up my au au au aura
Focus on my mind
Taking my-y time
I‚Äôm a new woman

Ni una era ser√° un flop
en mi porvenirputa soy la Rosal√≠a

La noche estrellada
As√≠ seaHasta la madrugada

No meu amor sempre tem dor

Sevdaliza
Can you remember when the last time was 
You felt safe 
In the dark
This world was never meant 
For a woman‚Äôs heart 
Still you rise 
Through it all 

When I‚Äôm out of breath she‚Äôs my vitals 
When I need to rev she‚Äôs my ride or die 
When I‚Äôm out of faith she‚Äôs my idol 
I just killed a man she‚Äôs my alibi

My baby doo doo 
Bisou dans le cou 
Sur mon corps tu donneras tout tout
Do u want it, do u want it too, 

Ton corps sera mon √©t√© 
Mmmm
J‚Äôai mis ton coeur de c√¥t√© 

Fini le temps des po√®tes,
Je les hais comme je les aime,

Lyrics:
You know I'm impatient
So why would you leave me waiting outside the station?
When it was like minus 4 degrees 
And I get what you're saying
I just really don't want to hear it right now
Can you shut up for like once in your life?
Listen to me
I took your nice words of advice about
How you think I'm gonna die
Lucky if I turned 33
Okay, so yeah, I smoke like a chimney
I'm not skinny and I pull a Britney
Every other week
But cut me some slack
Who do you want me to be?

'Cause I'm too messy
And then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job""
And you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect
'Til I open my big mouth
I want to be me
Is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever
And then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry
Unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect
'Til I show you that I'm not
A thousand people I could be for you
And you hate the fucking lot

You hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot

It's taking you ages
You still don't get the hint
I'm not asking for pages
But one text or two would be nice
And please, don't pull those faces
When I've been out working my arse off all day
It's just one bottle of wine or two
But hey, you can't even talk
You smoke weed just to help you sleep
Then why you're out getting stoned at 4 o'clock
And then you come home to me
And don't say hello
'Cause I got high again
And forgot to fold my clothes

'Cause I'm too messy
And then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job""
And you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect
'Til I open my big mouth
I want to be me
Is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever
And then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry
Unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect
'Til I show you that I'm not
A thousand people I could be for you
And you hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot

And I'm too messy
And then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job""
And you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect
'Til I open my big mouth
I want to be me
Is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever
And then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry
Unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect
'Til I show you that I'm not

Lyrics:
I took the page out of your favorite book¬†
You sold me lies just by the way you look
Taught me a language that I‚Äôll never speak¬†
Baby, that ain't for me 
That, that ain't for me
¬†
I dug my grave watching the way you move¬†
You took me higher than I ever flew
Too many times gave you a second chance
Baby I‚Äôm just a man¬†
I‚Äôm, I‚Äôm just a man¬†
¬†
No more thinking about you late night¬†
No more running around with your friends now
Done picking the pieces of my soul up off the floor
¬†
I said I would die for you baby¬†
But I can‚Äôt take this pain no mo¬†
I thought I was willing¬†
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door¬†
¬†
I don't want to lose you baby¬†
But I can‚Äôt play this game no mo
I thought it would kill me¬†
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door¬†¬†

You never thought this day would ever come¬†
When I looked you in the eyes and pulled the rug¬†
You tried to take away my sanity
Baby, that ain't for me 
That, that ain't for me 

Oh no more thinking about you late night¬†
No more running around with your friends now
Done picking the pieces of my soul from off the floor

I said I would die for you baby¬†
But I can‚Äôt take this pain no mo¬†
I thought I was willing¬†
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door¬†

I don't want to lose you baby¬†
But I can‚Äôt play this game no mo
I thought it would kill me¬†
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door¬†¬†

When I showed you the door¬† (X2)
But tonight I saved my life 

I said I would die for you baby¬†
But I can‚Äôt take this pain no mo¬†
I thought I was willing¬†
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door¬†

Lyrics:
We had a plan 
Move out of this town baby 
West to the sand We had a
It‚Äôs all we talked about lately 
I‚Äôd pack the car, bring your guitar and Jane for smoking 
First thing at dawn you‚Äôd cue the songs and we‚Äôd get going

But you weren‚Äôt home 
Waited on the porch for ya 
Sat there alone
All throughout the morn till I
Got a hunch, down in my gut 
And snuck around the back 
Empty cans and I‚Äôll be damned 
Your shit was never packed 

Did your boots stop workin? 
Did your truck break down?
Did you burn through the money? 
Did your ex find out? 
Where there‚Äôs a will then there‚Äôs a way and I‚Äôm damn sure you lost it 
Didn‚Äôt even say goodbye
Just wish I knew what caused it 

Was the whiskey flowing? 
Were you in a fight?
Did the nerves come get ya? 
What‚Äôs your alibi?
I made my way back to LA, and that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll be forgotten 
In 40 years you‚Äôll still be here, drunk, washed up in Austin 

A hell of bluff
You had me believin‚Äô
How many months
Did you plan on leaving
What happened, bad habits 
Did you go back,
Go batshit 
I loved you, how tragic

Did your boots stop workin? 
Did your truck break down?
Did you burn through the money? 
Did your ex find out? 
Where there‚Äôs a will then there‚Äôs a way and I‚Äôm damn sure you lost it 
Didn‚Äôt even say goodbye
Just wish I knew what caused it 

Was the whiskey flowing? 
Were you in a fight?
Did the nerves come get ya? 
What‚Äôs your alibi?
I made my way back to LA, and that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll be forgotten 
In 40 years you‚Äôll still be here, drunk, washed up in Austin

Lyrics:
Another shot she will love me again
Make it a double
 
Whiskey whiskey won‚Äôt you go away
Come again some other day
Cuz im in and came out to play
And I‚Äôm tired of it 
Tired of it
I don‚Äôt wanna wonder where she been
She was sitting now she gone again
Now its me and all my whiskey friends
And I‚Äôm tired of it
Tired of it
 
Speak
Dark brown skin 
Caught eye contact while walkin in
On the walk up
Perfect timing get beside me now we lockin in
She like tell me how you want it
On the rocks again
Lil salt around the rim
Fill to the top again
Fell back now im back in it
Del dia shots got me sinning
Big racks but these jeans skinny 
Plain Richard millie square business
See me in the club 2 steppin
Diamonds round my neck
Square dancing
You done made a gangsta romantic
Feenin for your love im an addict
So addicted ain‚Äôt none we can do about it
Country muthafucka
I say whats up
She say howdy
Call you my lil cow girl
How you ride it like a stallion
Don‚Äôt know why I love it
Can‚Äôt get tired of it
I‚Äôm on you bad

Whiskey whiskey won‚Äôt you go away
Come again some other day
Cuz im in and came out to play
And I‚Äôm tired of it 
Tired of it
I don‚Äôt wanna wonder where she been
She was sitting now she gone again
Now its me and all my whiskey friends
And I‚Äôm tired of it
Tired of it
 
Put you up
And hide you on the shelf 
I swear I‚Äôm through with you
You so hard to leave alone
Its always something new with you
Ain‚Äôt no way to get it gone gone gone
So I guess I‚Äôm going to Tiwan
She so cold I had to go and pour you over ice
Way you got me locked down you think whiskey was my wife
You so good I had to take you home and hit it twice
Two of you gone keep me up all night
 
Whiskey whiskey won‚Äôt you go away
Come again some other day
Cuz im in and came out to play
And I‚Äôm tired of it 
Tired of it
I don‚Äôt wanna wonder where she been
She was sitting now she gone again
Now its me and all my whiskey friends
And I‚Äôm tired of it
Tired of it
 
And I‚Äôm tired of it
Tired of it

Lyrics:
I can tell that you‚Äôre mad and I aint half surprised about that
Since the day that we met it‚Äôs always who cuts first and never who bleeds last
Rumors always turn into yelling and fighting 
And once it‚Äôs in your mind only one way you‚Äôre driving 
I know, I know 

Imma take the high road baby get stoned
Have a little too much of something terrible 
Imma let you cool down while I walk out 
You aint messing me up like the times before 
I don‚Äôt need a ticket to your shit show 
Knock yourself out and hit a new low 
Well Imma take the high road, take the high road, take the high road

You don‚Äôt wanna talk about it
Boy that‚Äôs no surprise 
You come home smelling like liquor like every other night
If I catch you with her, you ‚Äògon catch me with him
You think I don‚Äôt hear about it, you better think again
You now that rumors always turn into yellin‚Äò and fightin‚Äô
And once it‚Äôs in my mind, only one way I‚Äôm drivin, you know
I know 

Imma take the high road baby get stoned
Have a little too much of something terrible 
Imma let you cool down while I walk out 
You aint messing me up like the times before 
I don‚Äôt need a ticket to your shit show 
Knock yourself out and hit a new low 
Imma take the high road, take the high road, take the high road

Yeah Imma take the high road baby get stoned
Have a little too much of something terrible 
Imma let you cool down while I walk out 
You aint messing me up like the times before 
And I don‚Äôt need a ticket to your shit show 
Knock yourself out and hit a new low 
Imma take the high road, take the high road, take the high road
Imma take the high road, take the high road, take the high road

(Lyrics):
[Verse 1: Zach Bryan]
Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind
A beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

[Chorus: Zach Bryan]
A cold shoulder at closing time
You were b–µggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strang–µ words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves]
You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?
You're like concrete feet in the summer heat
It burns like hell when two souls meet
No, you'll never be the man that you always swore
But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves, Both, Zach Bryan]
A cold shoulder at closing time
You were beggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you
Cold shoulder at closing time
You were beggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

[Outro: Zach Bryan]
Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind
Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in my '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door

LYRICS:
Oh it‚Äôs like that
I‚Äôm your dream come true
When it‚Äôs on a platter for you
then you pull back
When i try to make plans
More than 2 hours in advance
I slam the door
I hit ignore
I‚Äôm saying no no no no more i
Got u blocked
After this
An after thought
I finally cut you off
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
with you off my mind
Floating through
The memories like whatever
You‚Äôre a waste of time
Your Signals are Mixed
You act like a bitch
you fit every stereotype
send a pic
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
With you out my life
It Feels
So
Good
Not caring where u are tonight
And it feels so good
Not pretending to like the wine u like
I slam the door
I hit ignore
I‚Äôm saying no no no no more i
Got u blocked
Excited
To never talk
I I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
with you off my mind
Floating through
The memories like whatever
You‚Äôre a waste of time
your Signals are Mixed
You act like a bitch
you fit every stereotype
send a pic
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
With you out my life
You want me
I‚Äôm done
You miss me
No duh
Where I‚Äôm at
I‚Äôm up
/ like a feather like a feather like a feather

Lyrics:
Girl, let's go put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
New truck, big lift, old roads
We've been tearing up since way back when
But these wheels are innocent
New hitch, new seats, no history
And you just can't fake that
 
So, let's change that, girl, let's go put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
Put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
All night, no brakes, all tail, no gate
Ain't gotta try too hard
My baby's push to start
All torque, full speed, off road
On me zero to a hundred fast
 
My foot ain't touch the gas
I said, hey baby, slow it down
Let's make it last
You said, where's the fun in that
Yeah, let's go
 
Put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
Put some miles on it
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
Put some miles on it
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
Mile after mile after mile after mile
Turn up the night like that radio dial
Shoulder to shoulder where nobody knows
Know where we're going, we ain't going home
 
We're putting miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California king
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
Put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
 
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
 
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
Put some miles on it

Lyrics:

I, I let you drive around my mind 
I can't count the times you made me feel like I‚Äôm nothin'
Played me like a fool 
Like a fool

Sayin' drink another whiskey 
Pop another pill 
Money makes you happy 
Heaven isn‚Äôt real 
You won‚Äôt find nobody to love 
Because your heart‚Äôs too broke 
Now I know 

You ain‚Äôt nothin but a liar 
Yeah I walked right out the fire 
Yeah you tried to keep me down 
Tried to put me underground 
But I‚Äôm only goin' higher 

I can hear you in my head 
In my bed when i‚Äôm dreamin' 
You try to be my friend but you‚Äôre blowin‚Äô smoke 
Oh and now I ain‚Äôt scared of tellin‚Äô you where you can go
'Cause I know 

You‚Äôre nothin‚Äô but a lie
You burned me one too many times 
Like a devil in disguise hidin‚Äô your true colors
Just leave me alone
Keep leadin‚Äô me on

Sayin' drink another whiskey 
Pop another pill 
Money makes you happy 
Heaven isn‚Äôt real 
You won‚Äôt find nobody to love 
Because your heart‚Äôs too broke 
Now I know 

You ain‚Äôt nothin‚Äô but a liar 
Yeah I walked right out the fire 
Yeah you tried to keep me down 
Tried to put me underground 
But I‚Äôm only goin' higher 

I can hear you in my head 
In my bed when I‚Äôm dreamin' 
You try to be my friend but you‚Äôre blowin‚Äô smoke 
Oh and now I ain‚Äôt scared of tellin‚Äô you where you can go
'Cause I know 
You‚Äôre nothin‚Äô but a liar

If I was doing what you do
You would say I poisoned you

You‚Äôre nothin‚Äô but a liar 
Yeah I walked right out the fire 
Yeah you tried to keep me down 
Tried to put me underground 
But I‚Äôm only goin' higher 

I can hear you in my head 
In my bed when I‚Äôm dreamin' 
You try to be my friend but you‚Äôre blowin‚Äô smoke 
Oh and now I ain‚Äôt scared of tellin‚Äô you where you can go

Ey
Mami, te siento lejo, dime d√≥nde est√°s

Que si est√°s conmigo, no te va a pasar na

Solo d√©jate llevar
Tate atenta a la fuga
(Si yo quiero contigo y t√∫ quiere' conmigo)

Estar sola, t√∫ prefiere'

Ven y dame un chance pa' guayarte
All√° vamo' a mojarte toa' las parte'
To'a la noche d√°ndote, d√°ndote

Lyrics:
I‚Äôd never met you but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in
With those green eyes never stolen by nobody

And they flicker to the future
For a moment I could picture
Then you touch me
And I come back and we‚Äôre talking on the staircase

Bout your big dreams, on the big screen
Out of Georgia now you‚Äôre lonely in this city
Lying with me
And you‚Äôre scared it‚Äôs moving quickly

Now you‚Äôre crying
You‚Äôre in pieces
Cause the only love you‚Äôve ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
And I hate that I‚Äôm the reason that you‚Äôre
You‚Äôre in your head right now
While your whole world is spinning out

So slow it down
Take a moment now
We‚Äôre too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubts
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
let me help you slow it down

Ain‚Äôt it funny, how it changes
How a future rearranges
I get nervous, oh I‚Äôm anxious
Maybe loving you is dangerous
I could lose you like the others
Only girl that‚Äôs never left me is my mother
Oh I love her
And I know you probably hate it

But I‚Äôm in my head my head right now

So slow it down
Take a moment now
We‚Äôre too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubts
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
let me‚Ä¶

Slow it
Slow it down
When you‚Äôre on the ground
And you‚Äôre crying
I‚Äôm just trying
To slow it down
When you‚Äôre spinning round
In your head

I‚Äôll help you slow it down

Lyrics: 
Usually these ol‚Äô neon lights
Are pretty good for bad goodbyes
They got some girls off of my mind
But baby not tonight
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôve been putting in overtime
Trying to get over your leaving
You‚Äôre still right here on my mind
You sure did a number on me
I‚Äôve tried Jack, I‚Äôve tried Jim
I‚Äôve tried every last one of them
Ol‚Äô heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don‚Äôt work and the buzz don‚Äôt help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
80, 90, everything they‚Äôve got
But the whiskey don‚Äôt kill like it‚Äôs supposed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof
There ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm driving home
I‚Äôm three sheets, done tied one on
But this liquor ain‚Äôt as strong
As your sweet love is
I‚Äôve tried Jack, I‚Äôve tried Jim
I‚Äôve tried every last one of them
Ol‚Äô heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don‚Äôt work and the buzz don‚Äôt help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
80, 90, everything they‚Äôve got
But the whiskey don‚Äôt kill like it‚Äôs supposed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof
All my favorite country songs
Guess they must‚Äôve got it wrong
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm still here and you ain‚Äôt gone
You ain‚Äôt gone, baby
I‚Äôve tried Jack, I‚Äôve tried Jim
I‚Äôve tried every last one of them
Ol‚Äô heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don‚Äôt work and the buzz don‚Äôt help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
80, 90, everything they‚Äôve got
But the whiskey don‚Äôt kill like it‚Äôs supposed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof

Official ‚Äúyes, and?‚Äù lyrics: 
in case you haven‚Äôt noticed
well, everybody‚Äôs tired 
and healing from somebody 
or something we don‚Äôt see just right

boy come on put your lipstick on
(no one can tell you nothing)
come on and walk this way through the fire 
(don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs on their mind) 
and if you find yourself in a dark situation just 
turn on your light and be like 

‚Äúyes, and?‚Äù
say that shit with your chest‚Ä¶.. and
be your own fuckin best‚Ä¶.. friend
say that shit with your chest‚Ä¶.. 
keep moving like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù
‚Äúyes, and?‚Äù

now i‚Äôm so done with caring 
what you think, no i won‚Äôt hide
underneath your own projections
or change my most authentic life

boy come on put your lipstick on 
(no one can tell you nothing)
come on and walk this way through the fire 
(don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs on their mind) 
and if you find yourself in a dark situation just 
turn on your light and be like 

‚Äúyes, and?‚Äù
say that shit with your chest‚Ä¶.. and
be your own fuckin best‚Ä¶.. friend
say that shit with your chest‚Ä¶.. 
keep moving like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù
‚Äúyes, and?‚Äù

my tongue is sacred, i speak upon what i like
protected, sexy, discerning with my time
your energy is yours and mine is mine
what‚Äôs mine is mine

my face is sitting i don‚Äôt need no disguise
don‚Äôt comment on my body, do not reply 
your business is yours and mine is mine
why do you care so much whose ! i ride
why?

‚Äúyes, and?‚Äù
say that shit with your chest‚Ä¶.. and
be your own fuckin best‚Ä¶..friend
say that shit with your chest‚Ä¶.. 
keep moving like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù
‚Äúyes, and?‚Äù

Lyrics:
There‚Äôs an old man in a La-Z-Boy
TV on a western, fast asleep¬†
Gray in his hair, at least what‚Äôs left
But the heart of a lion beating in his chest¬†
¬†
And there‚Äôs a little more slow in his go
A little less rock in his roll these days¬†
¬†
But I remember him 10 feet tall and bulletproof
Throwing me a ball in cowboy boots
A whistle and the dogs start running
A whisper and Mama starts blushing
A wrench in his hand and a beer in the other
God couldn‚Äôt make a man any tougher
And that S on his chest is starting to fade
But I‚Äôll always remember him that way
¬†
I used to think that he‚Äôd never get old
That kind of thing was for regular Joes
And he tries real hard to put up a fight¬†
But I guess time is his kryptonite¬†
¬†
‚ÄòCause I remember him 10 feet tall and bulletproof
Throwing me a ball in cowboy boots
A whistle and the dogs start running
A whisper and Mama starts blushing
A wrench in his hand and a beer in the other
God couldn‚Äôt make a man any tougher
And that S on his chest is starting to fade
But I‚Äôll always remember him that way
¬†
There‚Äôs a little more slow in his go
A little less rock in his roll these days
¬†
But I remember him 10 feet tall and bulletproof
Throwing me a ball in cowboy boots
A whistle and the dogs start running
A whisper and Mama starts blushing
A wrench in his hand and a beer in the other
God couldn‚Äôt make a man any tougher
That S on his chest is starting to fade
But there‚Äôs some things time can‚Äôt erase

END OF BEGINNING LYRICS:
Just one more tear to cry 
One teardrop from my eye 
You better save it for 
The middle of the night 
When things aren‚Äôt black and white 
Enter, Troubadour:
‚ÄúRemember 24?‚Äù
 
And when I‚Äôm back in Chicago, I feel it 
Another version of me, I was in it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning 
 
This song has started now 
And you're just finding out 
Now isn‚Äôt that a laugh? 
A major sacrifice but clueless at the time 
Enter, Caroline:
‚ÄúJust trust me you‚Äôll be fine‚Äù
 
And when I‚Äôm back in Chicago I feel it 
Another version of me, I was in it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning 
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
 
You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
You take the man out of the 
 
And when I‚Äôm back in Chicago, I feel it 
Another version of me, I was in it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning

He said, are you serious
I‚Äôve tried but i can‚Äôt figure out
I‚Äôve been next to you all night and still don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre about 
You keep talking
But not much coming out your mouth
Can‚Äôt you tell that i want you ?‚Äù

Baby please believe me
I‚Äôll put you through hell just to know me (ya ya) 
So sure of yourself

No it won‚Äôt end well 

I see you eyeing me down
But you‚Äôll never know much past my name 
Or how i‚Äôm running this room around
And that i‚Äôm still half your age
Yeah you‚Äôre l-l-looking at me like i‚Äôm some sweet escape 
Obvious that you want me but i said

Baby don‚Äôt get greedy
That shit won‚Äôt end well
No it won‚Äôt end well 

He said, ‚Äúi‚Äôm just curious

Can‚Äôt tell if you love or hate me 
Never met someone like that
Drive me so so so crazy
Did you know you got that effect?‚Äù
I said, ‚Äúlemme check‚Äù

Just to know me yeah yeah 
So sure of yourself

Lyrics: 
Baby you can
Find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up
Don‚Äôt you wanna just
Come along for the ride

Oh my outfit so tight
You can see my heart beat tonight
I can take the heat
Baby best believe
That‚Äôs the moment I shine

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don‚Äôt give a damn

When the nights here
I don‚Äôt do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won‚Äôt see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I‚Äôll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

Lately I‚Äôve been
Moving close to the edge
Still be looking my best
I stay on the beat
You can count on me
I ain‚Äôt missing no steps

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don‚Äôt give a damn

When the nights here
I don‚Äôt do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won‚Äôt see it on my face 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I‚Äôll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You‚Äôll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don‚Äôt play safe
Don‚Äôt you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Even when the tears are flowing
They‚Äôre diamonds on my face
I‚Äôll still keep the party going not one hair out of place
Even when the tears are flowing
They‚Äôre diamonds on my face
I‚Äôll still keep the party going not one hair out of place

Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won‚Äôt see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I‚Äôll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You‚Äôll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don‚Äôt play safe
Don‚Äôt you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Dance the night

About Dua Lipa:

We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can‚Äôt be sold 
We were right til we weren‚Äôt
Built a home and watched it burn

I didn‚Äôt wanna leave you 
I didn‚Äôt wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I

I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don‚Äôt understand 
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah I can love me better than you can
¬†
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
¬†
Paint my nails, cherry red 
Match the roses that you left 
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said

I didn‚Äôt wanna wanna leave you 
I didn‚Äôt wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I

I can buy myself flowers

[Verse 1: Megan Thee Stallion]
He know who I am, ain't had to say my name
Stack it up like Tetris but this money ain't a game
Watashi, kawaii ii karada
Drinkin' out the bottle, gettin' twisted, maruchan
Big exotic, Hermes, this a croc'
Watch too expensive, ain't no way I'm gettin' clocked
I think I'm so sexy, every shirt I own is cropped
So many karats, diamonds do the bunny hop (Ah)
In the US or Japan, if he meet me, he gon' bow
I got yen for your friends, if they pretty bring 'em out
Goin' dumb in Madam Woo, pourin' sak–µ in they mouth
Told him put me on his plate, bring th–µm chopsticks to the south

[Chorus: Megan Thee Stallion & Yuki Chiba]
I get money, I'm a star
Star, star, star, star, star, star
I get money, I'm a star

[Verse 2: Yuki Chiba]
Nagareru hoshitachi doko ni mukau?
Mata negai kanaenagara kurasu
Jyuuerrii mi ni tsuketa mama utau
Sutaatachi ga atsumatta sutajio
Yonayona sake takusan narabu ajito
Sakki made Roppongi de shuuroku rajio
Sokkara terebi satsuei suru hashigo
Kameratachi oikaketteru oretachi wo
Daisuki pika pika no daiya
Kurai toko kagayaiteru maiban
Nice to meet you suru aisatsu
I'm so happy arigataina

[Chorus: Megan Thee Stallion & Yuki Chiba]
I get money, I'm a star

Lyrics:
It always ends the same
when it was me and you
but every time I meet somebody new 
its like de ja vu

I swear they sound the same 
Its like they know my skin
every word they say sounds just like him 
and it goes like this

we‚Äôll get in ur car and 
you‚Äôll lean to kiss me 
we‚Äôll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat 

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night  
when everything changes  
You wont reply 
and we‚Äôll go back to strangers 

Uh huh uh huh

it‚Äôs something that I hate 
how everyones disposable 
now every time I date somebody new 
I feel vulnerable 

that it‚Äôll never change 
& it will just stay like this 
never ending dating breaking up
and it goes like this 

we‚Äôll get in ur car and 
you‚Äôll lean to kiss me 
we‚Äôll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat 

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night  
when everything changes  
You wont reply 
and we‚Äôll go back to strangers 

Uh huh uh huh

It always ends the same
when it was me and u 
but every time I meet somebody new 
its like de ja vu

when we spoke for months 
did u ever mean it? 
how can they say that this is love?
when it goes like this

we‚Äôll get in ur car and 
you‚Äôll lean to kiss me 
we‚Äôll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat 

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night  
when everything changes  
You wont reply 
and we‚Äôll go back to strangers 

Uh huh uh huh

Lyrics
Got me wide wide open 
Got a 45 on ‚Äòem 
And he‚Äôs pushing bout 102 
Always smoking something
He ain‚Äôt worried bout nothing 
Cause he ain‚Äôt got nothing to lose
 
I got a thang for the
Hard liquor on ice
Short days and long nights
Marlboros out the window
Middle finger to the sky
 
Say you wanna get dangerous 
Now you‚Äôre speaking my language
I forgot what your name is 
So imma call you mine
Imma call you mine
 
Got me wide wide open 
Got a 45 on ‚Äòem 
And he‚Äôs pushing bout 102 
Always smoking something
He ain‚Äôt worried bout nothing 
Cause he ain‚Äôt got nothing to lose
 
I got a thang for the wild ones
I got a thang for the wild ones
It‚Äôs like he knew
 
I got a thang for the wild ones
I got a thang for the wild ones
They like me too
 
I‚Äôm attracted to things that are really crazy
They asking me how I‚Äôve been feeling lately
If you coming for mine 
Then it‚Äôs do or die
No I won‚Äôt let it slide 
There‚Äôs no stealing bases
No back and forth arguing
No bitchin‚Äô and bargaining 
A whole lot of problems
Living in gotham 
And Bunnie‚Äôs my Harley Quinn
 
I was raised in the darkness
Forgive me I‚Äôm guarded
I have no shame I‚Äôm in love with the heartless
The demons have been chasing us 
If Police come and snatch us up
Remember that cowgirls don‚Äôt cry
 
Got me wide wide open 
Got a 45 on ‚Äòem 
And he‚Äôs pushing bout 102 
Always smoking something
He ain‚Äôt worried bout nothing 
Cause he ain‚Äôt got nothing to lose
 
I got a thang for the wild ones
I got a thang for the wild ones
It‚Äôs like he knew
 
I got a thang for the wild ones
I got a thang for the wild ones
They like me too
 as raised in the darkness
Forgive me I‚Äôm guarded
I have no shame I‚Äôm in love with the heartless
The demons have been chasing us 
If Police come and snatch us up
Remember that cowgirls don‚Äôt cry
 
Got me wide wide open 
Got a 45 on ‚Äòem 
And he‚Äôs pushing bout 102 
Always smoking something
He ain‚Äôt worried bout nothing 
Cause he ain‚Äôt got nothing to lose
 
I got a thang for the wild ones
I got a thang for the wild ones
It‚Äôs like he knew
 
I got a thang for the wild ones
I got a thang for the wild ones

Wild Wild Wild
They like me too
Wild wild wild

Wild Wild Wild
They like me too

Lyrics:
Ohhh 
I've been drinking more alcohol for the past 5 days 
Did you check on me? 
Now did you look for me? 
I walked in the room 
Eyes are red 
And I don't smoke banga 
Did you check on me? 
Now did you notice me? 
Nobody will know the paranoia
Cuz I put a smile on my face 
A facade you can never face 
And if you don't know me well well oh 
You won't see how buried I am inside my grave 
Inside my grave 

Cuz you see people 
People, people, people 
Don't really know you 
They don't really know you 
Cuz you see people 
People, people 
They don't really know you 
They don't really know you 

I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days 
Did you check on me? 
Now did you look for me? 
I walked in the room 
Eyes are red 
And I don't smoke banga 
Did you check on me? 
Now did you notice me? 

Oh holy father 
Oh holy father I dey try fo hold my head 
I say make you no leave me diko 
Oh holy father 
Yeah 
Oh, make you try fo understand 
Yahoo girl no dey for here 
Cuz you see people 
People 
People 
People don't really know you 
They don't really know you 
Cuz you see people

They don't really know you 
They don't really know you 

I've been drinking more alcohol for the past 5 days 
Did you check on me?

Eyes are red 
And I don't smoke banga 
Did you check on me?

I been a nasty girl, nasty

Pillow talking got my throat raspy

If you do it too good

Cuz it it feels like heaven when it hurts so bad
Baby put it on me

I aint got nothing underneath
Looks like, you boutta spend the night
Looks like, I‚Äôm boutta change your life

If you do it too good

Cuz it it feels like heaven when it hurts so bad
Baby put it on me

Lyrics
Holding me back,
Gravity‚Äôs holding me back,
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand,
Why don‚Äôt we leave it at that?,
Nothing to say,
When everything gets in the way,
Seems you cannot be replaced,
And I‚Äôm the one who will stay,
Ooh,
 
In this world,
It‚Äôs just us,
You know it‚Äôs not the same as it was,
In this world,
It‚Äôs just us,
You know it‚Äôs not the same as it was,
As it was,
As it was,
You know it‚Äôs not the same,
 
Answer the phone,
‚ÄúHarry, you‚Äôre no good alone,
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?,
What kind of pills are you on?‚Äù,
Ringing the bell,
And nobody‚Äôs coming to help,
Your daddy lives by himself,
He just wants to know that you‚Äôre well,
Ooh,
 
In this world,
It‚Äôs just us,
You know it‚Äôs not the same as it was,
In this world,
It‚Äôs just us,
You know it‚Äôs not the same as it was,
As it was,
As it was,
You know it‚Äôs not the same,
 
Go home,
Get ahead, 
Light speed internet,
I don‚Äôt want to talk about the way that it was,
Leave America, 
Two kids follow her,
I don‚Äôt want to talk about who‚Äôs doing it first,
(Hey!),
 
As it was,
You know it‚Äôs not the same as it was,

Favorite Song

I‚Äôm on the stage right now
Singing your favorite song
Look in the crowd and you‚Äôre no where to be found as they sing along 
I say,
You look good without no makeup
No lashes even better when you wake up 
uh-uh-uh
I see the look on your face
I see ya hiding the hate
I see ya looking for someone to scoop you right off of your feet
You wanna ride in a Wraith
You wanna go out on dates
You want somebody to come bring you flowers
Someone to talk to for hours
Wash your back while y‚Äôall sit in the shower
Someone to tell you ‚Äúyou‚Äôre beautiful‚Äù
Someone to tell you and mean it
Someone to tell you I love you everyday
And don‚Äôt got a reason
You want someone to bring you peace
Someone to help you sleep
Someone to pick you up when you feeling down feeling lonely
Need somebody
Who can make it better
Somebody
Who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you‚Äôll let me
I‚Äôm on the stage right now
Singing your favorite song
Look in the crowd and you‚Äôre no where to be found as they sing along 
I say,
You look good without no makeup
No lashes even better when you wake up 
uh-uh-uh
I see the look on you face
I see ya looking for peace
I see ya tired of the hurt
Tired of the pain 
Tired of the nights where you can‚Äôt get no sleep
I see you‚Äôre tired thinking bout if he cheat
See you‚Äôre tired thinking bout if you leaving
See you‚Äôre tired of being so tired
And ya damn sure ain‚Äôt getting even
Need somebody
Who can make it better
Somebody
Who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you‚Äôll let me
I‚Äôm on the stage right now
Singing your favorite song
Look in the crowd and you‚Äôre no where to be found as they sing along 
I say,
You look good without no makeup
No lashes even better when you wake up 
uh-uh-uh

‚ñ∫Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I‚Äôve ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices, they come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming one day I‚Äôll watch as you‚Äôre leaving ‚Äòcause you got tired of my scheming - for the last time

It‚Äôs me
Hi
I‚Äôm the problem, it‚Äôs me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I‚Äôll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I‚Äôm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman 
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming 
one day I‚Äôll watch as you‚Äôre leaving and life will lose all its meaning - for the last time 

It‚Äôs me
Hi
I‚Äôm the problem, it‚Äôs me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I‚Äôll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers ‚Äòround and reads it
And then someone screams out
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs laughing up at us from hell!‚Äù

It‚Äôs me
Hi
I‚Äôm the problem, it‚Äôs me

It‚Äôs me
Hi
I‚Äôm the problem, it‚Äôs me

It‚Äôs me
Hi

Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees

It‚Äôs me
Hi
I‚Äôm the problem, it‚Äôs me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I‚Äôll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I like the way you kiss me
I like the way you, uh

I like the way you kiss me
I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits

Not trynna be romantic
I‚Äôll hit it from the back
Just so you don‚Äôt get attached 

I like the way you kiss me
I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits

Not trynna be romantic
I‚Äôll hit it from the back
Just so you don‚Äôt get attached 

You bite my lip
Just for the taste
You‚Äôre on your knees
I‚Äôm on the case

You take the heat
And with such grace
You say we‚Äôre done but here u stay

Said you‚Äôre scared I‚Äôll let you down
Stick around and you‚Äôll find out
Don‚Äôt you wanna make me proud
Cause I‚Äôm so proud
Baby I‚Äôm so proud of you

I like the way you kiss me
I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits

Not trynna be romantic
I‚Äôll hit it from the back
Just so you don‚Äôt get attached 

I like the way you kiss me
I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits

Not trynna be romantic
I‚Äôll hit it from the back
Just so you don‚Äôt get attached 

Do I stress you out? 
Can I help you out ?
Does it turn you on
When I turn you round?
Can we make a scene
Can we make it loud
Cause I‚Äôm so proud
Yeh I‚Äôm so proud of you

Lyrics

It can‚Äôt be said I‚Äôm an early bird
It‚Äôs ten o‚Äôclock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well
You keep telling me to live right
To go to bed before daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don‚Äôt gotta pretend
Baby, now and then

Don‚Äôt you just wanna wake up
Dark as a lake
Smelling like a bonfire
Lost in a haze
If you‚Äôre drunk on life, babe
I think it‚Äôs great
But while in this world

I think I‚Äôll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You‚Äôre too sweet for me
You‚Äôre too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You‚Äôre too sweet for me
You‚Äôre too sweet for me

I aim low
I aim true and the ground is where I go
I work late where I‚Äôm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever babe
You treat your mouth as if it‚Äôs heaven‚Äôs gate
The rest of you like you‚Äôre the TSA
I wish that I could go along
Babe, don‚Äôt get me wrong

You know you‚Äôre bright as the morning
As soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine
As sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel
Maybe I‚Äôll wait
Until that day 

I‚Äôd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You‚Äôre too sweet for me
You‚Äôre too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You‚Äôre too sweet for me
You‚Äôre too sweet for me

I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You‚Äôre too sweet for me
You‚Äôre too sweet for me
